# COMMON CORE JS 

is now 

# [HOT GLUE](https://github.com/jasonfb/hot-glue)



When I first created this Gem, parents of children in grade school told me they didn't like the name "Common Core" because of the standardized math education system in America of the same name. As well, Common Core relied on a messy jQuery implementation that, while it wasn't very large, was outdated. With the release of Turbo-Rails in Dec 2020, I realized that basically the Common Core's least interesting part was how it managed the page state (Turbo Rails is really slick at this), and Common Core's best part is its ability to read your database and relationships for you.

So I've decided to re-brand and fully port the Common Core to a new work-in-progress Gem: [HOT GLUE](https://github.com/jasonfb/hot-glue). Please join me over there. -Jason
